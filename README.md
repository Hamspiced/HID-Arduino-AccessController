# HID-Arduino-AccessController
This is a project repository for creating a full fledged door access controller using an HID Reader, Arduino, and i2c screen.  This project will allow you to use the reader as a simple badge scanner, act as a door controller, identify authorized access control cards, add cards, and delete cards.
